The module uses an always block to assign the bitwise complement of the input to the output, effectively reversing the bit order. This is achieved by using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`). The `always @(*)` syntax ensures that the assignment happens on every clock cycle or any other time the input changes. The `begin` and `end` keywords are used to define a single statement block within the always block. The `~in` expression calculates the bitwise NOT of the input `in`, and this result is assigned to the output `out`.
