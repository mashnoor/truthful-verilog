Combinational logic means that the output is determined by the current values of the input signals without any delay.\n4. **Assignment Statement**: Inside the `always_comb` block, we use the assignment statement `out = in;` to assign the value of the input port `in` directly to the output port `out`.\n5. **Endmodule Statement**: The `endmodule` keyword marks the end of the module definition.\nThis Verilog code creates a simple module where the output is always equal to the input.
