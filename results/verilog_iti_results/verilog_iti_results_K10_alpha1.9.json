The error message is \"Error (10387): Syntax error: 'TopModule' expected.\" What could be causing this error?\nError (10387): Syntax error: 'TopModule' expected.\nThis error typically occurs when the Verilog simulator cannot find the definition of the `TopModule` module. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n1. **Ensure the Module is Correctly Defined**: Make sure that the `TopModule` module is defined in a separate Verilog file, such as `TopModule.v`, and that this file is included in your main design file where you intend to use it.\n2. **Check File Paths**: Ensure that the file path to the `TopModule.v` file is correct and accessible by the Verilog simulator.\n3. **Include the Module in Your Design File**: In your main design file, include the `TopModule` module using the `include` directive or by listing the module in the `module` statement. For example:\n   // Include the TopModule module\n   include \"TopModule.v\";\n   module MyDesign (\n       input in,\n       output out\n       // Instantiate the TopModule module\n       TopModule top_module (\n   endmodule\n4. **Verify Module Declaration**: Double-check that the module declaration in `TopModule.v` matches the interface specified in your design file. Ensure that the input and output ports are correctly declared.\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the syntax error related to the `TopModule` module.
