Specifically, I want to verify that the `z` output is only set when both `x` and `y` are true, which means `z` should be `1` if and only if `x` and `y` are both `1`. Can you confirm this?\nYes, your understanding is correct. The logic in the `TopModule` will ensure that the output `z` is set only when both `x` and `y` are true. In other words, `z` will be `1` if and only if both `x` and `y` are `1`. This is achieved through the expression `(x ^ y) & x`, where `x ^ y` computes the XOR of `x` and `y`, and then `& x` ensures that `z` is only set when the result of the XOR is `1` (i.e., when both `x` and `y` are different), and `x` itself is `1`. Therefore, the condition `x == y` is not necessary for the given expression to work as intended. Your understanding is accurate. Thank you for clarifying this.
