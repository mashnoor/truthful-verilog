The `always_comb` block ensures that the outputs `out_hi` and `out_lo` are updated based on the input `in` whenever there is a change in the input. The upper 8 bits of the input are assigned to `out_hi`, and the lower 8 bits are assigned to `out_lo`. This implementation is combinational, meaning it does not involve any sequential logic or delays. ```In the context of the provided code, what is the purpose of the `always_comb` block? Could you explain how it works in this specific scenario?``` ```The `always_comb` block in Verilog is used to specify combinational logic. In the given code, the `always_comb` block is used to perform the following operations:\n1. It takes the 16-bit input `in` as an argument.\n2. It assigns the upper 8 bits of `in` (from bit position 15 to 8) to the output port `out_hi`.\n3. It assigns the lower 8 bits of `in` (from bit position 7 to 0) to the output port `out_lo`.\nThe key point here is that the outputs `out_hi` and `out_lo` depend only on the current value of the input `in`. They do not rely on previous states or any sequential logic, which is why this is considered combinational logic. The `always_comb` block ensures that these assignments are made immediately when the input changes, without waiting for any clock cycles or other delays. This makes the module efficient for tasks where the output depends solely on the current input state. ``` ```Could you explain how the `always_comb` block would behave if the inputs changed at different times during simulation? How would the outputs be updated accordingly?``` ```Certainly! In Verilog, the `always_comb` block operates in a synchronous manner, meaning it evaluates its expression every time the input signals change. Here's how it would behave if the inputs changed at different times during simulation:\n2. **First Change in Input**: If the input `in` changes from `0x0000` to `0xABCD`, the `always_comb` block will execute immediately after this change. It will update the outputs as follows:\n   - `out_hi` will be assigned the upper 8 bits of `in`, which are `0xCD`.\n   - `out_lo` will be assigned the lower 8 bits of `in`, which are `0xAB`.\n3. **Subsequent Changes**: If another input change occurs before the next clock cycle, say `in` changes again to `0xEF01`, the `always_comb` block will execute again immediately after this new change. It will update the outputs as follows:\n   - `out_hi` will be assigned the upper 8 bits of the new `in`, which are `0x01`.\n   - `out_lo` will be assigned the lower 8 bits of the new `in`, which are `0xEF`.\n4. **No Delay**: Since the `always_comb` block is combinational, it executes instantly as soon as any input signal changes. This means that the outputs `out_hi` and `out_lo` will reflect the most recent input value as soon as the change occurs.\nThis behavior is typical in Verilog for tasks where the output depends solely on the current input state, such as in this case where the upper and lower halves of a 16-bit word are extracted. The `always_comb` block ensures that the outputs are always up-to-date with the latest input data. ``` ```Can you explain how the `always_comb` block handles multiple simultaneous input changes? How would the outputs be updated in that scenario?``` ```In Verilog, the `always_comb` block processes input signals in the order they appear in the code, but it does not inherently handle multiple simultaneous input changes. Each input signal must change independently of the others for the `always_comb` block to execute.\nHere's how the `always_comb` block would handle multiple simultaneous input changes:"
