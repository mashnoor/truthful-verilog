Can you explain how the `~` operator works in this context?\nCertainly! In Verilog, the `~` operator is used to perform a bitwise NOT operation on a single-bit value. This means that it flips the bits of the input. For example, if the input is `1`, the output will be `0`, and if the input is `0`, the output will be `1`.\nIn the context of implementing a NOT gate, the `~` operator is applied directly to the input signal `in`. The result of this operation is then assigned to the output signal `out`. This simple operation effectively inverts the logic level of the input, which is the core functionality of a NOT gate.",
