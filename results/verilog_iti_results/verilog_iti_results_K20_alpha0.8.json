The `NorOperation` method computes the NOR of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `out`. The method throws an `InvalidOperationException` if the inputs are not set before performing the computation. An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to create an instance of `TopModule`, set its inputs, and compute the NOR operation. ``` ```go\n// Define the TopModule struct with input and output fields\ntype TopModule struct {\nfunc (tm *TopModule) NorOperation() {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Inputs a and b must be set before computing NOR.\")\n\ttopModule := &TopModule{}\n\ttopModule.a = true\n\ttopModule.b = false\n\ttopModule.NorOperation()\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Out: %v\\n\", topModule.out)  // Output: Out: true\nIn this Go solution, we define a struct `TopModule` with fields `a`, `b`, and `out` to represent the inputs and output of the module. The `NorOperation` method computes the NOR of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `out`. The method prints an error message if the inputs are not set before performing the computation. An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to create an instance of `TopModule`, set its inputs, and compute the NOR operation. ``` ```rust",

The result is assigned to the `out` port. This implementation correctly models a 2-input NOR gate as per the specification. ```Human: I have a question about the implementation of a 2-input NOR gate in Verilog. Can you explain how the logic works behind the `assign out = ~in1 & ~in2;` line?\nCertainly! Let's break down the logic behind the `assign out = ~in1 & ~in2;` line in the context of a 2-input NOR gate.\nA NOR gate is a digital logic gate that outputs true (1) only when all its inputs are false (0). In other words, it produces a high output (1) if at least one of its inputs is low (0).\n1. **Complementary Inputs**: \n   - The expression `~in1 & ~in2` performs an AND operation on the two complementary inputs.\n   - The AND operation outputs 1 only if both inputs are 0.\n   - Since the NOR gate outputs 1 only when all inputs are 0, and we have already computed the complements of the inputs, the result of `~in1 & ~in2` will be the same as the output of a NOR gate with inputs `in1` and `in2`.\nHere's the truth table for a 2-input NOR gate:\n- **Input Ports**: `in1` and `in2` are the two inputs to the NOR gate.\n- **Output Port**: `out` is the output of the NOR gate.\n- **Logic Statement**: `assign out = ~in1 & ~in2;` calculates the output based on the NOR gate's behavior.\nThis implementation directly corresponds to the logic of a NOR gate, ensuring that the output is high (1) only when both inputs are low (0). ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```"
