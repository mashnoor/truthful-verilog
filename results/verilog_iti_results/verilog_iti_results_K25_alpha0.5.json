If it is, the function returns 0 immediately, which avoids the execution of the loop that would otherwise attempt to iterate over an empty list. This prevents errors and ensures that the function behaves correctly even when no input is provided. **Created Question**: How can I modify the `calculate_sum` function to also handle negative numbers? **Created Answer**: To modify the `calculate_sum` function to handle negative numbers, you can simply add the negative number to the `total` variable in the loop.

The `always @(*)` block is used to perform a combinational logic operation that counts the number of '1's in the input vector. We initialize the `out` variable to 0 and then iterate over each bit of the input vector. If a bit is '1', we increment the `out` variable by 1. This effectively counts the number of '1's in the input vector. ```Human: I need help with designing a simple digital circuit using Verilog. The circuit should take three binary inputs (A, B, C) and produce a single binary output (D). The output D should be '1' if at least two of the inputs A, B, or C are '1'. Otherwise, D should be '0'.\nCertainly! Below is a Verilog code for a simple digital circuit that meets your specifications. The circuit uses three binary inputs (A, B, C) and produces a single binary output (D). The output D is '1' if at least two of the inputs A, B, or C are '1', otherwise, D is '0'.\nmodule simple_circuit (\n    input wire A,\n    input wire B,\n    input wire C,\n    output reg D\nalways @(*) begin\n    // Check if at least two of the inputs are '1'\nendmodule\n- **Inputs**: The module takes three binary inputs, `A`, `B`, and `C`.\n- **Output**: The module produces a single binary output, `D`.\n- **Logic**: The `always @(*)` block contains a conditional statement that checks if any two of the inputs are '1'. If so, it sets `D` to '1'; otherwise, it sets `D` to '0'.",
