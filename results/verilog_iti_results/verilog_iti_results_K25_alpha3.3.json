The Python code is formatted in a way that is similar to the original Verilog code, but uses Python syntax instead of Verilog syntax. The function works by splitting the input string into lines, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from each line, and then joining the lines back together into a single string. The resulting Python code is returned as a string. ```python\nmodule TopModule (\n    input in,\n    output out\n    // Assign output to the same value as input\n    assign out = in;\nendmodule\nmodule TopModule (\n    input in,\n    output out\n    // Assign output to the same value as input\n    assign out = in;\nendmodule\nprint(equivalent)  # Output: True\nThis Python function `check_equivalence` takes two strings of Verilog code as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two codes are equivalent. The function works by converting both input strings to Python code using the `convert_verilog_to_python` function, and then comparing the two Python codes. If the two Python codes are identical, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two Verilog codes are equivalent. Otherwise, the function returns `False`. ```python\n# This is a Python function that generates a Verilog code for a module that implements a simple counter\n    # Add the module declaration line\n    verilog_code.append(f\"module Counter({num_bits} bits);\")\n    # Add the input and output declarations\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    input [0:{num_bits-1}] clk;\")\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    input reset;\")\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    output [0:{num_bits-1}] count;\")\n    # Add the register declaration\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    reg [{num_bits-1}:0] reg_count;\")\n    # Add the always block for the counter logic\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin\")\n    verilog_code.append(f\"            reg_count <= 0;\")\n    verilog_code.append(f\"            reg_count <= reg_count + 1;\")\n    # Add the output assignment\n    verilog_code.append(f\"    assign count = reg_count;\")\n    # Add the end module line\n    verilog_code.append(\"endmodule\")",
