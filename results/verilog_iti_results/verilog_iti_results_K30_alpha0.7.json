    "with_steering_implementation": "module TopModule (\n    input a,\n    input b,\n    output out\n    // Implement a 2-input AND gate\n    assign out = a & b;\nendmodule\nThis code defines a module `TopModule` with inputs `a` and `b` and an output `out`. It uses the logical AND operator (`&`) to compute the product of `a` and `b`, which is then assigned to `out`. This effectively implements a 2-input AND gate as per the given specification. ```In a scenario where you need to generate Verilog code programmatically, you can use a programming language like Python to automate this process. Below is an example of how you might write a Python script to generate the Verilog code for the `TopModule`:\ndef generate_verilog_module(module_name, inputs, outputs):\n    # Start with the module declaration\n    verilog_code = f\"module {module_name} (\\n\"\n    # Add input declarations\n    for input_port in inputs:\n        verilog_code += f\"    input {input_port},\\n\"\n    # Add output declarations\n    for output_port in outputs:\n        verilog_code += f\"    output {output_port},\\n\"\n    # Close the module declaration\n    verilog_code += f\"    // Implement a 2-input AND gate\\n\"\n    verilog_code += f\"    assign {outputs[0]} = {inputs[0]} & {inputs[1]};\\n\\n\"\n    # Close the module\n    verilog_code += \"endmodule\\n\"\n# Define the module name, inputs, and outputs\nmodule_name = \"TopModule\"\ninputs = [\"a\", \"b\"]\noutputs = [\"out\"]\nverilog_code = generate_verilog_module(module_name, inputs, outputs)\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `generate_verilog_module` takes three parameters: `module_name`, `inputs`, and `outputs`.\n2. **Module Declaration**: It starts by constructing the module declaration line, including all input and output ports.\n3. **Logic Implementation**: It adds the logic to compute the AND operation between the inputs and assigns the result to the output.\n5. **Usage**: The script defines the module name, inputs, and outputs, calls the function, and prints the generated Verilog code.\nThis approach allows you to easily modify the inputs and outputs by changing the lists passed to the function. You can further enhance the script to handle more complex modules or additional features as needed. ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```"
