Your task is to modify the function to include error handling for an empty list and return a meaningful message when this occurs.\nYou need to add appropriate error handling to ensure that the function returns a meaningful message when the input list is empty. Additionally, you should ensure that the function can handle lists with non-numeric values gracefully by ignoring them during the calculation.\nprint(calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 'a', 4]))  # Output: 2.5\nprint(calculate_average([]))              # Output: Error: List is empty\nprint(calculate_average(['a', 'b', 'c']))     # Output: Error: No valid numbers to calculate average\nprint(calculate_average([1, 2, 'a', 3]))     # Output: 2.0\nIn the modified function, we first use a generator expression to filter out any non-numeric values from the input list. This ensures that only numeric values are considered for calculating the average.\nAdditionally, we handle `TypeError` exceptions that might occur if the input list contains elements that cannot be converted to numbers, ensuring robustness of the function."
