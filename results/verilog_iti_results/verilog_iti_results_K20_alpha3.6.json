The `one` port is an output that always drives a logic high (1). The module uses an always block to handle the reset and clock signals. When the reset signal (`rst_n`) is low, the `one` port is set to 0. When the reset signal is high, the `one` port is set to 1. This ensures that the `one` port always drives a logic high, regardless of the input signals.
