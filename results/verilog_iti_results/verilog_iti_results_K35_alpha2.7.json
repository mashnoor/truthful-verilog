The module uses four registers to store each byte of the input vector and then assigns them back to the output vector in reverse order. ```Human: I have a question about the assignment of the reversed bytes to the output vector. Can you explain how this works?\nCertainly! In the Verilog code provided, the assignment of reversed bytes to the output vector is done using the following lines:\nassign out[7:0] = byte3;\nassign out[15:8] = byte2;\nassign out[23:16] = byte1;\nassign out[31:24] = byte0;\nEach of these lines assigns a byte from the input vector to a specific position in the output vector. Let's break down what happens:\n1. **byte3** is assigned to the least significant byte (LSB) of the output vector (`out[7:0]`). This means that the byte at the end of the input vector will be placed at the beginning of the output vector.\n2. **byte2** is assigned to the second least significant byte (`out[15:8]`). This places the next byte from the end of the input vector into the second position from the start of the output vector.\n3. **byte1** is assigned to the third least significant byte (`out[23:16]`). This continues the process, placing the next byte from the end of the input vector into the third position from the start of the output vector.\n4. **byte0** is assigned to the most significant byte (`out[31:24]`). Finally, the first byte from the end of the input vector is placed at the most significant position in the output vector.\nBy assigning each byte to the corresponding position in the output vector in reverse order, the byte order of the input vector is reversed, resulting in the desired output."
