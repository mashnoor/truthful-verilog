Can you explain how the XOR operation is performed in this code?\n1. **Input Ports**: The module takes two input ports, `x` and `y`, which are each one bit wide.\n2. **XOR Operation**: Inside the module, a wire named `xor_result` is declared to store the result of the XOR operation between `x` and `y`. The XOR operation is performed using the expression `x ^ y`.\n3. **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement assigns the value of `xor_result` to the output port `z`. This means that the value of `z` will be the same as the value of `xor_result`.\nIn the context of the code, `xor_result` will hold these values based on the input values of `x` and `y`.

It uses the `assign` statement to split the input `in` into two outputs: `out_lo` and `out_hi`, which correspond to the lower and upper 8 bits of the input, respectively. The input `in` is a 16-bit vector, and the outputs `out_lo` and `out_hi` are both 8-bit vectors. ```Given the following Python code snippet:\nModify the code to include error handling for cases where the input radius is negative or zero. If the input is invalid, the function should raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\nIn this modified version, the `calculate_area` function first checks if the input radius is less than or equal to zero. If it is, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message \"Radius must be positive.\" This prevents the calculation from proceeding with invalid inputs. ``` ``` ```python"
