The result is assigned to the output port `out`. ```Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list.\nIn this solution, we define a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as its parameter.

If the remainder when divided by 2 is zero, the number is even, and it is included in the resulting list `even_numbers`. Finally, the function returns the list of even numbers. This approach is efficient and concise, leveraging Python's powerful list comprehension feature to achieve the desired result. ```python\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\noutput_list = filter_even_numbers(input_list)\nprint(output_list)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n# - The function assumes that the input list contains only integers.
