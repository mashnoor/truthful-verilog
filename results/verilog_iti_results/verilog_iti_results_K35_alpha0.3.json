The `always` block is used to ensure that `out` is always driven to 0 (or logic low) when the reset signal `rst` is active (low), or when the clock signal `clk` is rising or falling edge. If `rst` is inactive (high), `out` remains at its previous value. ```Write a Python function to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of integers.\nInput: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]\nOutput: 6",

It is used to update the value of the output port `out` based on the current state of the design.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works in this specific context:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The block is designed to ensure that the output `out` is always driven to 0, regardless of the inputs or any other events within the module.\n\n2. **Timing Constraint**: The asterisk (`*`) in `always @(*)` means that the block will execute every time the module's sensitivity list changes. In this case, since there are no sensitivity lists specified, the block will execute continuously.\n\n3. **Block Execution**: Inside the block, the statement `out = 0;` is executed every time the block is triggered. This sets the value of `out` to 0, which is the desired behavior according to the problem specification.\n\n4. **Effect**: By using `always @(*)`, the module ensures that the output `out` is always updated to 0, even if the module is reset or re-initialized. This provides a stable and predictable output behavior.\n\nIn summary, the `always @(*)` block in this context is crucial for maintaining the output `out` at a constant low level, ensuring that the module behaves as specified."
