It is a single-bit signal.\n5. `assign out = ~ (a ^ b);`: This line implements the logic for the XNOR gate. The `^` operator performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`. The `~` operator negates the result of the XOR operation, effectively implementing the XNOR gate. The result is assigned to the `out` port.\nThis Verilog code correctly implements an XNOR gate using the specified input and output ports. The XNOR gate outputs `1` only when both inputs are the same (`0` or `1`). Otherwise, it outputs `0`. ```Human: What is the difference between a synchronous and asynchronous reset in digital circuits? Provide a detailed explanation of each type of reset with examples.\nIn digital circuits, a reset is a signal used to clear the state of flip-flops or registers. There are two main types of resets: synchronous and asynchronous.\nConsider a simple register circuit with an asynchronous reset. The register holds the value of the input signal until the reset signal is received. Here's how the circuit might look:\n|       Input      |----->|       Register   |\nIn this circuit, the register holds the value of the input signal until the reset signal is received. The flip-flop acts as a latch that holds the value of the register until the next positive edge of the clock signal."
