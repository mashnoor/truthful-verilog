The Space Exploration exhibit costs $15 per ticket, the Astronomy exhibit costs $20 per ticket, and the Robotics exhibit costs $25 per ticket. If the group buys tickets for all three exhibits and spends a total of $90, how many tickets did they buy for each exhibit? To determine how many tickets the group bought for each exhibit, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:"

The output is assigned the value of the input using a combinational assignment statement. This ensures that the output will always be the same as the input, regardless of any changes in the input signal. ```In this solution, I've created a Verilog module named `TopModule` with the specified input and output ports. The module uses a combinational assignment statement to connect the output port to the input port, ensuring that the output always reflects the current state of the input. This implementation meets the requirements specified in the original problem description.``` ```python\n# Define the TopModule class with input and output ports\nclass TopModule:\n    # Method to set the input port value\n    # Method to get the output port value\n# Create an instance of TopModule\ntop_module = TopModule()\n# Set the input port value\ntop_module.set_in_port(1)\n# Get the output port value\noutput_value = top_module.get_out_port()\nprint(f\"Input: {top_module.in_port}, Output: {output_value}\")\nThis Python code defines a class `TopModule` with methods to set and get the input and output port values.
