    "without_steering_implementation": "module TopModule (\n    output reg zero\nalways @(*) begin\nendmodule\nThis code defines a module `TopModule` with an output port `zero`. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the value of `zero` is updated to `1'b0` whenever the module is instantiated or reconfigured. This results in the module always outputting a LOW (`1'b0`). ```Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.\ndef remove_vowels(input_string):\n    result = ''.join(char for char in input_string if char not in vowels)\nprint(remove_vowels(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Output: \"Hll, Wrld!\"\nThis function `remove_vowels` works by iterating over each character in the input string and including it in the result only if it is not a vowel. It uses a set of vowels for quick membership testing, which makes the function efficient. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result. ``` ``` ```python\ndef count_vowels(input_string):\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\nprint(count_vowels(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Output: 3\nThis function `count_vowels` counts the number of vowels in the input string. It uses a set of vowels for quick membership testing and iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the count whenever a vowel is found. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result. ``` ``` ```python\ndef reverse_string(input_string):\n    reversed_string = input_string[::-1]\nprint(reverse_string(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Output: \"!dlroW ,olleH\"\nThis function `reverse_string` takes a string as input and returns a new string that is the reverse of the original. It uses Python's slicing feature to create a reversed copy of the string. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result. ``` ``` ``` ```python\ndef is_palindrome(input_string):\n    cleaned_string = input_string.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()\nprint(is_palindrome(\"A man a plan a canal Panama\"))  # Output: True\nprint(sort_numbers([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]))  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\nThis function `sort_numbers` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in ascending order. It uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result. ``` ``` ``` ```python\nprint(find_max_number([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]))  # Output: 9\nThis function `find_max_number` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the list",

The algorithm iterates through the list, maintaining a running sum (`current_sum`) and updating the maximum sum (`max_sum`) whenever a larger sum is found. If at any point the `current_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to zero because starting a new subarray from the next element would yield a higher sum.

The truth table for a NOR gate is as follows:\n| Input 1 (A) | Input 2 (B) | Output (Y) |\nA NOR gate outputs a high (1) signal only when both of its inputs are low (0). If either or both inputs are high (1), the output is low (0). This behavior can be understood by considering the logical negation of the OR operation.\n1. **OR Operation**: The OR operation outputs a high (1) if at least one of the inputs is high (1). For example, OR(0, 0) = 0, OR(0, 1) = 1, OR(1, 0) = 1, OR(1, 1) = 1.\n2. **NOT Operation**: The NOT operation inverts the output of the OR operation. If the OR operation outputs 0, the NOT operation outputs 1, and vice versa. For example, NOT(0) = 1, NOT(1) = 0.\n3. **NOR Operation**: The NOR operation is the result of applying the NOT operation to the output of the OR operation. Therefore, NOR(0, 0) = NOT(OR(0, 0)) = NOT(0) = 1, and so on.\n- **Behavior**: Outputs a high (1) if both inputs are high (1), otherwise outputs a low (0).\n- **Behavior**: Outputs a high (1) if either input is high (1), otherwise outputs a low (0)."
