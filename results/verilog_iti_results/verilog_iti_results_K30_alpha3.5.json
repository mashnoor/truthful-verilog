The expression `a ^ b` computes the XOR of the two input signals, and the `~` operator negates the result, giving the desired XNOR output.\nThis implementation correctly implements the XNOR gate using Verilog. ```What is the purpose of the `always @(*) begin` block in the Verilog code?\nAssistant:The `always @(*) begin` block in the Verilog code is used to create a combinational logic circuit that updates its output based on the current values of its input signals. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:\n1. **Combinational Logic**: A combinational logic circuit takes one or more inputs and produces an output based solely on those inputs, without any memory or state. In this case, the XNOR gate is a combinational logic circuit.\n2. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**: This type of block is synchronous because it responds to changes in the input signals immediately. It does not require a clock signal to operate.\n3. **Event Sensitivity**: The `@(*)` syntax indicates that the block should be sensitive to all input signals. This means that if any of the input signals change, the block will re-evaluate its logic and update the output accordingly.\n4. **Block Structure**: The `begin ... end` block contains the logic that defines how the output is computed based on the input signals. In this example, the logic is simply `out = ~ (a ^ b)`, which computes the XNOR of inputs `a` and `b`.\n5. **Immediate Update**: Because the `always @(*)` block is combinational, its output is updated immediately whenever any of its input signals change. This ensures that the output reflects the current state of the inputs, without any delay.\nIn summary, the `always @(*) begin` block is crucial for creating a dynamic and responsive combinational logic circuit that can accurately compute the XNOR operation based on the current input values. ``` ```Create a Verilog testbench for the TopModule module to verify its functionality.\nmodule TopModule_tb;\n    // Input signals\n    reg a;\n    reg b;\n    // Output signal\n    wire out;\n    // Instantiate the TopModule module\n    TopModule top_module (\n        $display(\"Testing XNOR gate with various inputs:\");\n        $display(\"Inputs: a = %b, b = %b, Output: %b\", a, b, out);\n        $display(\"Inputs: a = %b, b = %b, Output: %b\", a, b, out);\n        $display(\"Inputs: a = %b, b = %b, Output: %b\", a, b, out);\n        $display(\"Inputs: a = %b, b = %",
