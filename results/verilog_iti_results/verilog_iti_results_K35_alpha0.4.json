The `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n)` block ensures that the reset condition is checked on both positive and negative edges of the clock, making it a valid reset mechanism. The `zero` output remains low regardless of any other signals or changes, as specified in the requirements. ```Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion."
