    "with_steering_implementation": "module TopModule (\n    output reg one\nalways @(*) begin\nendmodule\nIn this Verilog code, the `TopModule` module has a single output port `one`. The `always @(*)` block ensures that the `one` port is always driven to `1`, regardless of any changes in the input signals. The `reg` keyword is used to declare `one` as a register, which allows it to retain its value across clock cycles. The `begin` and `end` blocks are used to group the assignment statement into a single block. This is a common practice in Verilog to improve readability and maintainability of the code. The `always @(*)` block is sensitive to all input signals, but since there are no input signals in this case, it simply drives the output port to `1` every time.
