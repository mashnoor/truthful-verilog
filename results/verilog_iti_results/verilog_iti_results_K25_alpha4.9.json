It takes a 16-bit input `in`, and it outputs two 8-bit signals: `out_hi` and `out_lo`. The module uses bitwise assignment to split the input into the upper and lower halves. The `assign` statement is used to connect the input bits directly to the output registers, ensuring that the values are updated whenever the input changes.
