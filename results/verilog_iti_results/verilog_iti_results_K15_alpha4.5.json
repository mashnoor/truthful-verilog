It uses an `assign` statement to connect the `out` port directly to the `in` port, effectively making the module behave like a wire. The module is then closed with the `endmodule` statement. ```Human: I need help with a Verilog module that performs a bitwise AND operation on two input bits. Can you provide a simple example?\nCertainly! Below is a simple Verilog module that performs a bitwise AND operation on two input bits. The module has two input ports, `a` and `b`, and one output port, `result`.\nmodule BitwiseAnd (\n    input a,\n    input b,\n    output result\n    // Assign the result of the bitwise AND operation to the output port\n    assign result = a & b;\nendmodule\n- **Module Declaration**: The `module` keyword is used to define a new module named `BitwiseAnd`.\n- **Input Ports**: Two input ports, `a` and `b`, are declared using the `input` keyword. These ports will receive the binary values that you want to AND.\n- **Output Port**: One output port, `result`, is declared using the `output` keyword. This port will output the result of the bitwise AND operation.\n- **Logic**: Inside the module, the `assign` statement is used to compute the bitwise AND of `a` and `b` and assign the result to `result`. The `&` operator performs the bitwise AND operation.\nTo use this module in your design, you can include it in another Verilog file and instantiate it. Here's an example of how you might do this:\nmodule TopModule;\n    // Declare input and output signals\n    reg a, b;\n    wire result;\n    // Instantiate the BitwiseAnd module\nendmodule\nIn this example, the `TopModule` instantiates the `BitwiseAnd` module and connects its inputs and output to signals `a`, `b`, and `result`. The `initial` block contains some test cases to demonstrate how the module works.",
